        <item id="introText">{b}{i}{u}Do expectations meet reality? Using q-method to assess the role of and impact on 3D wellbeing in transitioning to regenerative agriculture amid farmers in Ireland.{/u}{/i}{/b}
The aim of the project is to evaluate the role of and impact on three-dimensional wellbeing (subjective, material, relational) in farmers transitions to regenerative agriculture (an umbrella term for socio-ecological practices). Questions being considered are: 
{i}What aspects of wellbeing are farmers looking to improve? 
How does practicing regenerative agriculture impact wellbeing?{/i}
The hypothesis is that subjective and relational aspects of human wellbeing (such as social networks, sense of responsibility etc) will have a considerable role in deciding to transition, suggesting the need for incentives to go beyond solely finances. The study will compare the wellbeing motivations/expectations (this Q sort) with the experienced wellbeing outcomes (second Q sort), identifying support gaps to better inform policy steering the agricultural transition, increasing effectiveness and adoption. This is a farmer centred holistic approach, recognising farmer wellbeing as an indicator of truly sustainable socioecological agriculture.
